    <h1>Excerpt from "Hidden Powers"</h1>
    <p>Isabelle threw another rock at the back of Dakota’s armour. Clang clang clang clang. Dakota had been putting up with it for a while. She was finally fed up.

<div>“WOULD YOU STOP THAT!?” Dakota shouted, catching the rock before it hit her armour. Isabelle shrugged and threw another rock.</div>

<div>“AAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUG,” Dakota growled and walked away.</div>

<div>“Wait you were my catcher,” Isabelle said sarcastically.</div>

<div>“What’s wrong with ‘the child’?” Annabelle.</div>

<div>“I think she’s bored,”Ruth said.</div>

<div>“What do you mean? It looks like she found something to do,” Sarah said, pointing to the empty spot where Isabelle sat before.</div>

<div>“Hey, did you guys tell Isabelle to leave?” Simeon asked, entering the room where the kids were.</div>

<div>“No, why?” Annabelle said. </div>

“Because she was leaving the Cow Barge or whatever this place is called,” Simeon said.

“Which direction did she go?” Sarah asked, standing up.

“South of here If i’m not mistaken”

“Oh no,”

“AAARGG Isabelle why can’t you sit still for one minute!” Dakota said walking towards the tree that everyone used to climb down.

“Just a little further now,” Justine said, as she walked down the chasm.

“Suilad,” a voice said behind them.

“WHAT?!” squealed Audrey jumping almost three feet in the air.

“What i, suilad?” Farren said in Sindarin

“Bazinga!” Isabelle yelled as Justine held her hand up, illuminating Isabelle’s face. Justine slapped an open palm onto her forehead, Farren started laughing, Vismai gave Isabelle a high-five and Audrey just stared back and forth at Justine and Isabelle, waiting to see who would talk first.

“Well I guess you’re here now,” Justine finally said.

“Yep! So no getting rid of me,” Isabelle cheerfully said 

“The dragon pit is this way,” Farren said, pointing to the right.

“Everyone ready?” Justine asked

“No,” Vismai responded. “Isabelle needs to get her weapons ready.” 

“I dropped it somewhere back there” Isabelle admitted, walking back a few steps and summoned her lightsaber with the force.

“AAH, oh, I forgot you could do that,” Farren said.

Isabelle smiled mischievously before calling back to Justine, “I’m ready now!” Justine held her hands out above the pit, seeing just how many dragons there were. To her dismay, she could see no dragons, but there was a black and green lizard staring back up at the light coming  off of Justine’s hands.

“Um, I thought there were dragons down here,” Audrey said.

“There were,” Isabelle said, pointing to a pile of dragon bones in the corner, “just not anymore.”

“The lizard just killed them all?” Justine asked.

“That would be the most realistic option, because a troll cannot kill a dragon,” Farren said.

“Ow, ” Isabelle said suddenly.

“Sorry,” A voice said behind them. Justine held up her hand towards the tunnel, to reveal the rest of the kids flashing embarrassed smiles.
